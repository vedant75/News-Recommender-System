# News-Recommender-System
This project implements a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network to build a personalized news recommendation system. Leveraging the Microsoft News Dataset (MIND), modeled user-article interactions as a bipartite graph to predict the probability of a user clicking on a specific news article.

By utilizing Graph Attention Networks (GAT) within a heterogeneous graph structure, this model captures complex, non-linear collaborative signals and content-based features (article categories) to solve the cold-start problem effectively.
